## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-transit-gateway/releases).


### Simple Example
Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:
```hcl
      module "transit_gateway2" {
      source = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-transit-gateway.git"

      name        = "transit"
      application = "test"
      environment = "dev"
      label_order = ["environment", "name", "application"]
      default_route_table_association = "enable"
      default_route_table_propagation = "enable"
      auto_accept_shared_attachments = "enable"
    }
```
